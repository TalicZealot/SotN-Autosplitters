# How to set up an autosplitter with Xbox / Console

* Download and set up following the readme [Auto-Split](https://github.com/Toufool/Auto-Split)
* Use the OBS window as the basis for comparison.
* Use the **Take Screenshot** feature to get snapshots for the splits you want, then use an editing software to cut away everything except the key element for the comparison.
* Use **L2 Norm** Comparison method.
* Use custom thresholds and cooldowns for splits to minimize processing while maximizing reliability.
* Save settings to a file.
* I recommend using the LiveSplit component.
